## ðŸ’¼ Executive Summary

This project proposes a dual-technology strategy to address inefficiencies in India's EV charging infrastructure through:

1. **Blockchain-Enabled Battery Swapping** â€“ enabling secure, traceable, and automated EV battery transactions.
2. **Kinetic Energy Harvesting** â€“ creating decentralized clean energy points in high-traffic zones.

Together, these solutions aim to transform EV adoption by combining technological feasibility with business viability, while aligning with sustainability goals.
